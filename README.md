# EC2-Instance-Automation - AUTOMATING EC2 INSTANCE MANAGEMENT WITH AWS LAMBDA AND EVENTBRIDGE FOR COST OPTIMIZATION.

In today's cloud-driven world, managing costs while maintaining efficient infrastructure is critical. AWS offers a range of tools that can help automate resource management, enabling businesses to optimize operations and reduce unnecessary spending. In this project, I demonstrate how to use AWS Lambda, EventBridge, and IAM to automate the start and stop of EC2 instances, showcasing my skills in programming, automation, serverless technologies, and cloud cost-saving strategies.

Project Overview:
The essence of this project lies in automating the management of an EC2 instance, ensuring that it runs only when necessary. By leveraging AWS Lambda and EventBridge, I created an efficient solution to start and stop the instance at predefined intervals, helping to significantly reduce operational costs.

Steps:
EC2 Instance Setup: I began by creating an EC2 instance that would be the focal point of this automation. The goal was to automate its lifecycleâ€”starting and stopping it without manual intervention.
IAM Role Creation: Two separate IAM roles were created to ensure secure access control:
Developing Lambda Functions: Using Python and AWS Lambda, I wrote two separate scripts:
Configuring EventBridge Rules: To automate the process, I set up two EventBridge rules:

Results and Benefits 
This project successfully demonstrated the ability to automate cloud resource management while reducing costs. By ensuring that the EC2 instance only runs when needed, I was able to minimize operational expenses and optimize resource usage. The automation also eliminated the need for manual intervention, improving overall efficiency and reliability.

The approach can be extended to various scenarios, such as scaling infrastructure based on demand or automating other routine tasks, further highlighting the flexibility and power of AWS serverless technologies.

Conclusion
This project underscores the importance of automation in cloud environments, particularly when it comes to cost optimization. By leveraging AWS services like Lambda and EventBridge, businesses can achieve significant cost savings while maintaining operational efficiency. The skills demonstrated here can be applied to a wide range of cloud automation tasks, making it a valuable strategy for any organization looking to optimize its AWS usage.
